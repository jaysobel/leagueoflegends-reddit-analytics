# Exploring Reddit's r/leagueoflegends 

I built the dataset for this project by using reddit's API to search post titles containing each champion's name between 2013 and 2017. I processed the API results into a SQL database with 400k rows.

Data exploration took place in Tableau, and some of the plots I created can be found in the visuals folder.

On desktop, interactive plots with tooltips and all the nice tableau UI elements can be found [here on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jay1053#!/vizhome/rleagueoflegendsChampionsandKarmaTrends/datastory).
